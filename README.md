# Maru OS

Welcome to the Maru OS Project!

[Maru](http://maruos.com) makes personal computing more context-aware by giving you the best interface for your environment. That means when you're on the go, Maru is your phone; when you're at your desk, Maru is your desktop. It's that simple!

To be more precise, Maru is an operating system that enables interactive virtual environments on Android. It's based on the Android Open Source Project and focuses on mobile hardware. It uses lightweight OS virtualization (containers) to spin up virtual systems on demand, and provides a bridge into Android's I/O framework for interactivity.

## Structure

Maru is a fairly large project with code split across several repositories.

AOSP bits are usually prefixed with android_.
